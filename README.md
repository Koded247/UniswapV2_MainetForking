# Uniswap V2 Mainnet Fork for KuCoin Token (KCS) / Threshold (T) Token Pairs

## Overview
This project is a fork of Uniswap V2 deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, specifically tailored to support trading pairs involving KuCoin Token (KCS) and Threshold (T) token. It enables decentralized, automated liquidity provisioning and token swaps for KCS, T, and other ERC-20 assets.

## Features
- **Uniswap V2 Protocol**: Fully compatible with the Uniswap V2 AMM model.
- **KuCoin Token (KCS) / Threshold (T) Token Pairs**: Supports liquidity pools involving KCS and T tokens.
- **Ethereum Mainnet Deployment**: Runs on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring high security and decentralization.
- **Custom Fee Adjustments**: Option to modify swap fees and liquidity incentives.
- **Optimized Smart Contracts**: Gas-efficient contract execution with tested security measures.

## Deployment
### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm/yarn
- Hardhat or Truffle
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with mainnet ETH
- Infura or Alchemy API key


## Usage
- **Adding Liquidity**:
  - Use the provided frontend or interact with smart contracts directly to add liquidity to KCS/T-based pairs.
- **Swapping Tokens**:
  - Utilize Uniswap-compatible interfaces like Uniswap UI or custom frontend.
- **Withdrawing Liquidity**:
  - Remove liquidity through the smart contract interface or frontend.

## Security Considerations
- Smart contracts are based on Uniswap V2, which has been audited.
- Ensure proper key management and use hardware wallets for high-value transactions.
- Always verify contract addresses before interacting with them.
